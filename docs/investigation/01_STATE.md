# Investigation State

## Iteration
- Current iteration: 0001
- Phase: PHASE_6_TRACEABILITY

## Progress
Completed:
- PHASE_1_INVENTORY (iteration 0001): Full file inventory, 141 in-scope files, 1 ignored.
- PHASE_2_TOPIC_MAP (iteration 0001): Topic map covering all in-scope files (141 rows), 16 distinct topics identified.
- PHASE_3_TEST_SPEC (iteration 0001): 82 behaviors extracted from 43 test files across 4 packages.
- PHASE_4_BEHAVIOR_CATALOG (iteration 0001): Publicity classifications verified. 2 reclassified. 4 unknowns resolved.
- PHASE_5_DOC_CLAIMS (iteration 0001): 107 claims extracted from 6 doc files. Verified: 75. Unverified: 32. Contradicted: 0. Notable unverified: DOC-0089 (effects.yaml path discrepancy between docs), DOC-0092 (user config path inconsistency between core README and root README), DOC-0100 (orchestrator process syntax may be outdated — positional vs flag).

Current focus:
- Build traceability matrix linking DOC claims to BHV behaviors and code evidence.
