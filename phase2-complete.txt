Phase 2: Layered Effects Integration - Complete
================================================

Date: 2026-02-05
Branch: feature/phase2-integration

Summary
-------
Successfully integrated layered-effects package into wallpaper-core CLI,
enabling 3-layer configuration (package/project/user) for effects.

Test Results
------------
Core Unit Tests: 11/11 passing
CLI Loading Tests: 4/4 passing
Integration Tests: 29/29 passing (including 5 layered effects tests)

Changes Made
------------
1. Added get_package_effects_file() helper to effects module
2. Removed effects field from CoreOnlyConfig
3. Initialized layered-effects at module level in main.py
4. Added comprehensive error handling for effects loading
5. Removed SchemaRegistry registration for effects
6. Added 11 new unit tests for integration
7. Verified all integration tests pass

Key Features
------------
- Users can define custom effects in ~/.config/wallpaper-effects-generator/effects.yaml
- Projects can have local effects.yaml that extend package defaults
- User effects can override package defaults
- Clear, actionable error messages for configuration issues
- Deep merge across all three layers (package/project/user)

Breaking Changes
----------------
For developers importing wallpaper-core:
- CoreOnlyConfig no longer has effects field
- Must use layered_effects.load_effects() directly

For CLI users: None (transparent change)

Next Steps
----------
Ready for code review and merge to master.
